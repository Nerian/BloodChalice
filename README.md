Challenge Exercise: Exponential Chaos
-------------------------------------

My wife and I play a lot of board games. After getting beat, time and time
again, I decided it was time to find some games where we could work together.
After experimenting with a few, we quickly found our two favorites: Pandemic
and Forbidden Island. But now that we've played them so much, we're looking for
more. That's where you come in. During this assignment, your going to create
your own cooperative board game using similar mechanics to those in Pandemic
and Forbidden Island. You should attempt to model the game and let a single
player play a few turns via the console. You don't need fancy graphics or
design. Some components that your game could have are:

- Node based map
- Game controlled antagonist who manupulates the board
- Collecting X items Y times to beat the game

Below are some links to videos and/or rules for each of the games. Also
included are references to some other coop games if you find yourself needing
more inspiration.
